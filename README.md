### Problem Statement
Travellers are always in need to find accommodation that best suits them in terms of budget and convenience. They tend to visit multiple websites to compare destinations and hence can be very tiresome. This app provides a centralized place to display information about multiple destinations. 

### Solution statement
Create a Travels App that allows users to browse through multiple destinations and be able to easily compare prices and ambience.


### Project MVP/User Stories
A user:
- can view all the available destinations : The app sends GET request for all destinations from the api
- can view details of individual destinations: The app sends GET request for individual destination. The individual destination should have: id, name, image/s, date form, description, cost, availability, button for booking
- can book their stay at their preferred destination : The app sends a POST request to add a booking of a specific user 


### Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Bootstrap
json-server


### Future Plans
1. Add user routes in order to effectively make, update and delete bookings of each destination.
